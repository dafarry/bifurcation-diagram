**bifurcation-make-images.py**

  This is the python script for generating the images as a sequence of
  png files in a subdirectory "vid". It is Python 2.7 compatible but
  should be run with the 2.7 compatible version of the Pypy jit-compiler
  so that it completes in ~30 minutes rather than 30 hours.
  Requires the "Pillow" fork of the "PIL" image library.
  Tested on Ubuntu -- and uses Ubuntu's location of its fonts.
  The script is dense and not very readable because it was created by
  stepwise refinement to improve visualisation of the animation.

**bifurcation-add-reverse.sh**

  Bash script to add the reversed sequence to the images, created
  from the existing images, so that the animation runs forward then
  backwards in a loop.

**bifurcation-make-vid.sh**

  Bash script to convert png image sequence to mp4 video.
  Needs the "real" ffmpeg that's in most very recent
  Linux distros but not the "fake" ffmpeg that's a front-end to
  avconv that was in many distros until just recently.

  **install-pypy-on-ubuntu.md**

  Installing Pypy on Ubuntu proved to be a bit fiddly, so a bunch
  of notes are included here to install it with the needed libraries.
